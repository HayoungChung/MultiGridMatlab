# MultiGridMatlab

The purpose of this repository is to provide Matlab code for geometric multigrid that is easy to understand and learn from. 

Start with the ![1D Multigrid Tutorial](1DMultigridTutorial/) if you want to understand how multigrid works. This is idea for the beginner to walk through, with plots at every step.

Writting or enhancing a code like ![2D Multigrid](2DMultigrid/.) would make a great class project. Perhaps extend 2D to 3D for a short assignment, or add some advection for more difficulty.

This short ![PDF](NutshellMultigrid2.pdf) explains the math behind the code.
